![Shield Lib Banner](docs/image/banner_128.png)

---
### Shield Lib is a library that makes it easy to add custom shields with banner support, enchantments, custom shapes, & custom effects across Fabric & Neoforge without conflicts!

### We also provide event hooks & modifier registries for shields and shield enchantments for creating custom effects with them by modifying blocking, disabling, movement, or cooldown.

## Enchanting:

## Tooltips:
